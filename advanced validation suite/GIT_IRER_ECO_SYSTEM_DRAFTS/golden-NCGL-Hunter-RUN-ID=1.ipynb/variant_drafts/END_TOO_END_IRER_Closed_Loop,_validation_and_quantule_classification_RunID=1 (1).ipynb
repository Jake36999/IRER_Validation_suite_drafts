        "\n",
        "This repository contains the complete, end-to-end closed-loop system for the Adaptive Simulation Steering Engine (ASTE). This system is designed to autonomously run physics simulations, validate the scientific results, and use an evolutionary algorithm to \"hunt\" for parameters that optimize for scientific fidelity.\n",

        "1.  **`adaptive_hunt_orchestrator.py` (The Driver):** The main entry point for the entire system. It coordinates all other components to execute the full \"Adaptive Hunt Loop\".\n",
        "2.  **`aste_hunter.py` (The \"Brain\"):** Manages the `simulation_ledger.csv`. It reads validation reports, calculates fitness (`1 / SSE`), and breeds the next generation of parameters.\n",
        "3.  **`worker_v7.py` (The \"Worker\"):** The JAX-based physics engine. It runs a single simulation and is architected with `jax.lax.scan` to resolve HPC compilation errors.\n",
        "4.  **`validation_pipeline.py` (The \"Validator\" / Asset A6):** The Spectral Fidelity & Provenance (SFP) module. It runs the scientific analysis, generates the `config_hash`, and calculates the final `log_prime_sse` and Aletheia Coherence Metrics (PCS, PLI, IC).\n",
        "5.  **`quantulemapper.py` (The \"Profiler\" / CEPP v1.0):** The core scientific analysis engine. This is a dependency called by the `validation_pipeline.py` to perform the actual multi-ray sampling, FFT, and classification.\n",

        "3.  **Job Execution:** The orchestrator will loop through each parameter set (e.g., 4 jobs for Generation 0). For each job, you will see:\n",
        "      * `[Orchestrator] -> Calling Worker: worker_v7.py`\n",

        "      * `[Orchestrator] <- Validator ... OK.`\n",

        "5.  **Loop:** The system will repeat Step 3 for all jobs in Generation 1.\n",

        "3.  **Clean Workspace:** Before starting the main orchestrator, run the cleanup cell to delete old artifacts (`*.csv`, `*.h5`, `*.json`). This ensures your `simulation_ledger.csv` isn't polluted by old, failed runs.\n",

        "  * **Traceback (in Subprocess Log):** `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'worker_v7.py'`.\n",
        "  * **Diagnostic:** This is the most common setup failure. It means the Python script file that the orchestrator or validator is trying to import or run does not exist on the disk.\n",
        "  * **Tipbit:** You **must** run all the `%%writefile` cells at the top of the notebook to create the `.py` files *before* you run the main orchestrator script.\n",
        "\n",
        "-----\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2\\. JAX `TypeError` (The \"HPC Gap\" Error)\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Traceback (in Worker Log):** `TypeError: Non-hashable static arguments are not supported` or `jax.errors.ConcretizationTypeError`.\n",
        "  * **Diagnostic:** This is the critical **HPC Gap**. It means a JAX array (like `k_vectors` or `k_squared`) is being passed as a static argument to a JIT-compiled function instead of being managed as dynamic state.\n",
        "  * **Tipbit:** This error indicates a regression in our `worker_v7.py` script. The **mandated solution** is to ensure all JAX arrays are bundled *inside* the `SimState` `NamedTuple` and passed as the `carry` variable to `jax.lax.scan`. Check that no JAX arrays are being passed as `static_argnames` or closed over from the global scope.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "### 3\\. `KeyError` (The \"Data Contract\" Error)\n",

        "  * **Traceback (in Hunter Log):** `KeyError: 'log_prime_sse'` or `KeyError: 'spectral_fidelity'`.\n",
        "  * **Traceback (in Orchestrator Log):** `KeyError: 'param_kappa'`.\n",
        "  * **Diagnostic:** The \"data contract\" between the components is broken. The `validation_pipeline.py` produced a `provenance.json` with a structure that `aste_hunter.py` did not expect.\n",
        "  * **Tipbit:** Manually open the `provenance_...json` file from the `provenance_reports` directory. Compare its structure to the `provenance_artifact` dictionary defined in `validation_pipeline.py` and the parsing logic in `aste_hunter.py`'s `process_generation_results` function.\n",

        "### 4\\. `FileNotFoundError` (The \"Workflow\" Error)\n",

        "  * **Traceback (in Validator Log):** `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'simulation_data/rho_history_...h5'`.\n",
        "  * **Traceback (in Hunter Log):** `FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'provenance_reports/provenance_...json'`.\n",
        "  * **Diagnostic:** This is a **workflow dependency failure**. The `worker_v7.py` failed (likely with the JAX `TypeError` above) and never created its HDF5 artifact. This caused the `validation_pipeline.py` to fail, which in turn caused the `aste_hunter.py` to fail.\n",
        "  * **Tipbit:** **Always read the logs from top to bottom.** The *last* error (e.g., in the Hunter) is almost always caused by an *earlier* error (e.g., in the Worker).\n",

        "\n",
        "## 💡 Final Tipbits\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Be Patient with JAX:** The *very first job* of Generation 0 will be slow (30-60 seconds). This is **normal**. It's JAX JIT-compiling the entire `worker_v7.py` physics loop. All subsequent jobs will be extremely fast (1-2 seconds).\n",
        "  * **Check the Ledger:** The ultimate source of truth is the `simulation_ledger.csv` file. After the run, download and open it. If it contains 8 rows (for 2 generations of 4) and all `log_prime_sse` and `fitness` columns are populated, the entire end-to-end run was a **100% success**."
